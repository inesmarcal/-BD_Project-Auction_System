## To run this project:
After installing PgAdmin, Postman and all libraries:
1. Create a database with the configurations specified in the file "api_configurations.txt" that is inside the folder "resources"
2. Download the src folder and create the tables using the script "cria_tabelas.sql"<br>
3. Before pass to Postman create an Admin User<br>
4. In Postman create some end-points (for more information see the Report)<br>
5. Create a folder called "logs" on same folder of the file "api.py"
6. Finally just run it
```shellscript
[your-disk]:[name-path]> python api.py
```
